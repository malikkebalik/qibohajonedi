楽曲のセンスや、ライブでのアグレッシヴさなど、ワンオクの音楽をリードする大切な存在です。
TAKAさんとToruさんの二人は、結成時から現在まで仲良しであります。創始期からのメンバーで、しかも同じハンカチ世代（1988年生まれ）の同級生。
バンドのリーダーと、作詞作曲をするボーカルなので、バンドの核となっている二人だけに仲良しなのは嬉しいことですね！
ちなみに、TAKAさんとToruさんは同じマンションに住んでいると、過去にインスタライブで語っていたことがありました。
ToruとTAKAは同じマンションに住んでいた！超仲良し ワンオクのリーダーでありギターのToruさんと、そのワンオクで”顔”ともいえるTAKAさん。
バンドの楽曲を作る際には、主にこのツートップが中心になることが多いです。
そんな二人ですが、実はToruさんが独身だった時代は一緒に住んでいたそうです！
この話は2020年の4月にTAKAさんが自身のインスタライブで話した情報であります。
TAKAさんはインスタライブでサラッと話すと、それだけでファンの間で拡散されました。
2020年時点でワンオクメンバーで独身はTAKAとToruのみだった Toruさんといえば、2021年に女優の大政絢さんと結婚して話題になりました。
実は2020年の時点でONE OK ROCKのメンバーで独身はTAKAさんとToruさんだけだったのですが、2021年にToruさんが結婚したことによって独身はTAKAのみになりました。
インスタでの発言も2020年だったことから、現在は別々に住んでると思われます。
そもそもTAKAさんはアメリカ・ロサンゼルスでの生活を中心にしている為、日本でToruさんと一緒に住んでた自宅はサブ的な扱いだった可能性が高いです。
UVERworldのように音楽活動用のマンション？ ちなみにTAKAさんが尊敬するUVERworldは、都内にメンバーみんなが集まれるマンションを持っていることで有名です。
そこで軽くセッションしたり、一緒に曲を作ったりしてるそうです。
ワンオクでの作曲の中心になっているTAKAさんとToruさんなので、もしかしたら現在も作曲用にマンションは使われているかもしれませんね。
場所はどこ？2018年にTAKAが浅田舞、Toruが引中綾香を港区のマンションに連れ込む TAKAさんといえば、2018年頃に浅田舞さんとの熱愛が報道されました。
Toruさんも現在の嫁さんと結婚する手前、2018年に人気アナウンサーの引中綾香さんとの交際が話題でした。
実は二人とも、自宅マンションから女性の出入りが週刊誌にキャッチされています。
Toruさんと引中綾香さんは港区の自宅マンションの下で、記者に直接突撃されています。
浅田舞さんはTAKAさんと半同棲状態にあると報じられていました。
もしかして、当時の港区のマンションで大物カップルが一緒にいた？なんてことも考えられます。
引中綾香アナウンサーと、浅田舞スポーツキャスターがタトゥーだらけの男の溜まり場に一緒の場所にいたと思うと、ちょっとおもしろいですね。
ちなみにTAKAさんの報道ではマンションは”芸能人マンション”と表現されており、Toruさんの報道では港区にあるマンションだと報道されていました。
TORU(ワンオク)は幼稚園の頃からモテモテ！ Toruさんは幼児園の頃から、今の可愛い顔立ちは健在で、年上の女性に可愛がられていました。
TORUさんは幼少期の頃からモテモテでした。
幼稚園の頃からバレンタインにチョコをたくさん貰い、初めての彼女は小学生の頃の1歳年上だったそうです。
小学生の頃の初めての彼女は、Toruさんもずっと好きだったみたいで、初カノにして、しっかりと両思いを実らせてたのです。
なんてませてるのか・・・、そんなにモテて羨ましいです。
TAKAとToruを繋げた（紹介）女友達はToruと仲良くなりたくて仲介した 2005年に結成されたONE OK ROCKですが、ワンオクの結成秘話を聞いてると、当時からToruさんがモテモテだったことがわかります。
当時にTORUさんにタカさんを紹介した女性がいて、実はその女性はTORUさん目当てだったということがあったそうです。
TAKAさんを紹介することによって、TORUさんと仲良くなれると計算しての仲介をされたのです。
その女性がToruさんにTAKAさんを紹介したことによって、今のONE OK ROCKが誕生したとされています。
ちなみに、その後に女性とToruさんが恋人関係になることはありませんでした。
もしかしたら、現在も友達という形でつながり、ライブに呼ばれるぐらいはしてるかもしれませんが。
Toruは女側からグイグイ来てほしいタイプ？ 女性に困ったことのないTORUさんは、積極的に行くよりも、ぐいぐい来てくれた方が良いみたいです。
バンドでは仲間をまとめ、引っ張る存在なのに、恋愛の部分では真逆のようです。
個人的な憶測だと、女性よりも、男の仲間といた方が、楽しく思えるタイプだと思うので、今後、結婚までは時間がかかりそうです。
ワンオクが海外で波に乗り始めた時期なだけに、結婚によって私生活のバランスを崩してほしくないですね。
仮に結婚するとしたら、やはり海外の方でしょうか？
すでに洋楽に片足入ってるので、価値観を広げる意味で、海外の余生は魅力的におもえます。
TORUのイケメン度はワンオクで1番！TAKAよりモテる？ TORUさんがタカさんよりも、イケメンだと言われる理由に、スタイルの良さが挙げられます。
TORUさんの公表してる身長は、１７７センチと、かなりの長身！
そして、瘦せ型ということで、体重はおそらく６０キロ前後をキープしてることでしょう。
男性として理想的な身長に理想的な体重に、理想的な顔立ち、そして若くして世界的なバンドに駆け上がってる段階と、あらゆる面で、TORUさんのイケメン度は最高です！
この先もバンドが活躍する中には、TORUさんのヴィジュアルにやられる、いわゆる顔ファンが多く出現すると思いますが、それでもついでにあの名曲たちを聞けば、すぐに音楽てきな部分で惚れさせることができると思います。
やはり、イケメンがリードするバンドって素敵です！
