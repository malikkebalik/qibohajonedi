By this point he had already won La Liga with Barcelona and the FA Cup with Spurs, and had established himself as one of Europe’s leading managers.</p><p>The way his time with England ended, though, is also illustrative of another element of his career.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Venables announced that he would step down from the job a few months before Euro 96 as he continued to manage legal battles from his time as Spurs manager. These battles followed him leaving the club three years earlier when on May 13, 1993, the Spurs chairman Alan Sugar and his legal team put a resolution to the board to remove Venables from his job as chief executive, ending his six-year spell at the club.</p><p>Two years earlier Sugar had enlisted Venables to be his chief executive when he had taken control of Spurs and become chairman.The split in 1993 was a hugely acrimonious one, going all the way to the High Court, where Venables’ dismissal was upheld.</p><p>The fans and players were pretty much all on Venables’ side, speaking to his huge popularity. Venables was very much a larger-than-life character.</p><p>In the 1970s, he co-wrote the James Hazell detective novels and he owned Scribes West, a drinking den for the rich and famous in Kensington, west London.</p><p>This was all part of the Venables — nicknamed ‘El Tel’ — package. He was so much more than just a football player and manager. To his critics he didn’t win enough to justify the hype, but the adoration he felt from players and fans always spoke volumes.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/12/01033248/GettyImages-830512048.jpg alt width=1928 height=1378 sizes="(max-width: 1928px) 100vw, 1928px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Terry Venables became Tottenham chief executive after Alan Sugar’s takeover in 1991 (PA Images/Getty Images)</span><h2>‘Venables brought England together – you wanted to do well for him’</h2><p>Speaking to The Athletic in an article first published in 2021, Alan Shearer — with the help of his former team-mates — relives Euro 96 – including the infamous ‘dentist’s chair’ incident:&nbsp;</p><p>“What happened out there brought a nice unity,” Teddy Sheringham, my old strike partner, tells me. “Venables had a lovely way of bringing the squad together. We were allowed out and alright, we went a little bit reckless, but it was our one night out two weeks before the start of a major competition. It ain’t that a big deal really, the way I saw it, although the media made a big deal of it.</p><p>“Terry wasn’t best pleased, but he was brilliant. He just said to the press, ‘I let them out, it’s my fault’. The way he protected us was just the kind of man that he is. Fantastic. He just said to us, ‘Let’s come together and get on with it’. You wanted to do well for him.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“Terry was just so calm,” Incey says. “There was no hollering or shouting. Anyway, he couldn’t have a go at us because Robbo was his No 2 and he’d been having a few beers with us that night!</p><p>“But I think he enjoyed the fact he could use the tool of what happened. That’s what I liked about him. He simplified everything. You had that fine line where you respected him and couldn’t go overboard, but he also looked after you and thought the world of you. That was the turning point for us.”</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Shearer, Gazza and co relive Euro 96 - Venables, the magic, the dentist's chair, that Scotland goal and the heartbreak</p></a><h2>Venables, the England manager: ‘Most beautiful summer’</h2><p>The Athletic’s Oliver Kay:</p><p>On a sun-kissed afternoon just off the Costa Brava, at his hotel hidden between the mountains and the olive groves, Terry Venables wistfully cast his mind back to that heady summer of 1996, when, as the song would have it, football came home.</p><p>“It was the most beautiful summer,” he told me. “The football we played, against Holland and Germany, was amazing. The feeling we had at Wembley, it was beautiful. We beat Holland 4-1, but we were just as good against Germany in the semi-final. We did everything but score the winner. Extra-time… I can still see it now…”</p><p>In his mind’s eye, Paul Gascoigne is sliding in, centimetres away from scoring the “golden goal” that would have taken England to a final against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=776 href=#>Czech Republic</a>. “That’s the one,” Venables said. “Gazza, my lovely boy. He deserved to score, but it wasn’t to be.</p><p>“And then penalties and… Gareth [Southgate] missed one, the bugger. No, I’m joking. It was hard on him. Anyone could miss a penalty. But… penalties again. Same as the European Cup final [in 1986, when his Barcelona team were beaten by Steaua Bucharest].”</p><p>Unlike any England manager since, Venables left on a high note, with everyone – the players, the public, the media – wishing for more.</p><p>Well, almost everyone. He was always at loggerheads with Noel White, the chairman of the FA’s international committee, who continually expressed misgivings about Venables behind the scenes. Not about his coaching credentials, which were outstanding, but about the reputational damage potentially caused by various legal and business issues. White objected to extending Venables’ contract, prompting the coach to declare that he would leave once Euro 96 was over.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>England’s oldest surviving manager said it “would have been nice” to take the team on to the 1998 World Cup, by which time David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Michael Owen had emerged, but did not dwell on regrets. Unlike so many other England managers, he did not seem scarred by the experience.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>What it's really like to manage England</p></a><p>(Photo: Jamie McDonald/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGlvcm5kZnxzfJFsZmppX2eDcMDEq6myZaaau6Kuy56qZpyZmsBurcaeZg%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fterry-venables-former-england-tottenham-barcelona-manager-dies-aged-80.html&title=Terry%20Venables%3a%20Former%20England%2c%20Tottenham%2c%20Barcelona%20manager%20dies%20aged%2080" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fterry-venables-former-england-tottenham-barcelona-manager-dies-aged-80.html&description=Terry%20Venables%3a%20Former%20England%2c%20Tottenham%2c%20Barcelona%20manager%20dies%20aged%2080" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fterry-venables-former-england-tottenham-barcelona-manager-dies-aged-80.html&title=Terry%20Venables%3a%20Former%20England%2c%20Tottenham%2c%20Barcelona%20manager%20dies%20aged%2080" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fterry-venables-former-england-tottenham-barcelona-manager-dies-aged-80.html&title=Terry%20Venables%3a%20Former%20England%2c%20Tottenham%2c%20Barcelona%20manager%20dies%20aged%2080" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fterry-venables-former-england-tottenham-barcelona-manager-dies-aged-80.html&text=Terry%20Venables%3a%20Former%20England%2c%20Tottenham%2c%20Barcelona%20manager%20dies%20aged%2080" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fterry-venables-former-england-tottenham-barcelona-manager-dies-aged-80.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Larita Shotwell</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-07-16</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./tim-tracker-height-weight-age-spouse-family-facts-biography.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Tim Tracker Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Family, Facts, Biography</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./nyt-crossword-clue-answers-for-august-31-2023.html><h3>NYT Crossword clue answers for August 31 2023 >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
