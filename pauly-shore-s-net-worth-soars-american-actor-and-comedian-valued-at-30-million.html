He gained fame through his comedic roles in popular films such as “Encino Man,” “Son in Law,” and “In the Army Now.” However, Shore’s talents extend beyond acting as he is also a stand-up comic, director, producer, and podcaster.</p><p>In addition to his successful film career, Pauly Shore has made significant contributions to the world of comedy. His 2014 mockumentary titled “Pauly Shore Stands Alone” won the award for Best Documentary at the Downtown Film Festival Los Angeles. He has also hosted podcasts such as “Pauly Shore Podcast Show” and “Pauly Shore’s Random Rants.”</p><p>Shore comes from a family deeply rooted in comedy, as his parents owned West Hollywood’s famous Comedy Store since the early 1970s. After his mother’s passing in 2018, Pauly took over managing the club. Growing up surrounded by comedians had a profound influence on him, and he even performed his first stand-up set at a young age of 17.</p><p>One of Pauly Shore’s career breakthroughs came when he landed a job as an MTV VJ in 1989. He held this position until 1994 and became well-known for hosting shows like “MTV Spring Break” and appearing on the “MTV Video Music Awards.” MTV also gave him his own show called “Totally Pauly,” which ran for six years.</p><p>Apart from his work in television and film, Shore has released three comedy albums throughout his career. His debut album titled “The Future of America” was released in 1991, followed by “Scraps from the Future” in 1992 and “Pink Diggily Diggily” in 1994.</p><p>While Pauly Shore has experienced both successes and setbacks in his career, he continues to remain active in the entertainment industry. He has appeared on various television shows, including “Entourage,” “Workaholics,” and “Alone Together.” Additionally, Shore has written, directed, produced, and starred in several mockumentaries and comedy specials.</p><p>In terms of personal life, Pauly Shore has had relationships with notable figures such as Tiffani Thiessen and Kylie Minogue. However, he also faced a tragic incident when he was with adult film star Savannah during her passing at Burbank’s St. Joseph’s Hospital in 1994.</p><p>Shore’s financial success is evident through his real estate investments. In 1996, he purchased a 4,500 square foot home in the Hollywood Hills for $1.5 million. After renovating the property in 2015, he initially listed it for sale at $13 million but later decided to rent it out for $27,000 per month. In 2020, the mansion was put back on the market with an asking price of $9.5 million.</p><p>Overall, Pauly Shore’s net worth reflects his accomplishments as a versatile entertainer who has made significant contributions to the world of comedy through acting, stand-up comedy performances, directing, producing, and podcasting.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=2_From_MTV_VJ_to_Millionaire_Pauly_Shores_Net_Worth_Revealed></span>2.

He gained fame for his comedic roles in movies like “Encino Man,” “Son in Law,” and “In the Army Now.” However, Shore’s talents extend beyond acting; he is also a stand-up comic, director, producer, and podcaster. In fact, his 2014 mockumentary titled “Pauly Shore Stands Alone” won the award for Best Documentary at the Downtown Film Festival Los Angeles. Additionally, he has hosted podcasts such as “Pauly Shore Podcast Show” and “Pauly Shore’s Random Rants.”</p><p>Shore comes from a family deeply involved in comedy. His parents, Mitzi Shore and Sammy (a comedian), owned West Hollywood’s renowned Comedy Store since the early 1970s. After Mitzi passed away in 2018, Pauly took over as the club’s manager. Growing up with three siblings in a Jewish household, Pauly was exposed to comedians from an early age. At just 17 years old, he performed his first stand-up set at Culver City’s Alley Cat Bistro.</p><p>One significant milestone in Pauly Shore’s career was when he became an MTV VJ in 1989. He held this position until 1994 and hosted shows like “MTV Spring Break” and appeared on the “MTV Video Music Awards.” The network even gave him his own show called “Totally Pauly,” which ran for six years.</p><p>Aside from his work on MTV, Shore released several comedy albums throughout the 1990s. His first album titled “The Future of America” came out in 1991, followed by “Scraps from the Future” in 1992 and “Pink Diggily Diggily” in 1994. He also ventured into television and film, making his debut on the show “21 Jump Street” in 1987 and starring in movies like “For Keeps?” in 1988.</p><p>While Shore experienced success with films such as “Encino Man,” “Son in Law,” and “In the Army Now,” not all of his projects fared well at the box office. For instance, “Jury Duty” (1995) was considered a flop, and “Bio-Dome” (1996) received mixed reviews. Despite these setbacks, Shore continued to pursue his passion for comedy, writing, directing, producing, and even starring in various projects.</p><p>Throughout his career, Pauly Shore has been romantically linked to several notable individuals. He dated Tiffani Thiessen, his co-star from “Son in Law,” as well as Kylie Minogue from “Bio-Dome.” However, one tragic event marred his personal life when adult film star Savannah (Shannon Wilsey) died by suicide in 1994 while Shore was present at the hospital.</p><p>In terms of property ownership, Pauly Shore purchased a 4,500 square foot home in the Hollywood Hills for $1.5 million in 1996. In 2015, he renovated the house but struggled to find a buyer when he listed it for $13 million. As a result, he decided to rent it out for $27,000 per month. In 2020, Shore put the mansion back on the market with an asking price of $9.5 million.</p><p>Overall, Pauly Shore’s diverse talents and successful career have contributed to his impressive net worth of $30 million. From his early days as an MTV VJ to becoming a renowned comedian and filmmaker, he has left an indelible mark on the entertainment industry.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=3_The_Wealthy_World_of_Pauly_Shore_How_the_Actor_and_Comedian_Built_His_30_Million_Fortune></span>3.
