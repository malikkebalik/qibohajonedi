The positioning of the Swiss flag makes this one look a bit like a shirt handed out to first aiders at a fun run, but actually compared to the other Puma/shield horrors. This isn’t quite as bad as the others. The thin hoopy pattern behind the shield is a nice reference to the home shirt, and white and red usually tends to look decent whatever the circumstances. But still: please make all this stop.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Rating: 5/10</p><h3 class=p1>Tunisia</h3><p dir=ltr lang=en>Official: Tunisia Homa & Away WC Kit 2022</p><p>Drive: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/hD8LhTBuhC</a>…<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">#pes2021</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">#pes21</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">#peskit</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">#kitmaker</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">#eFootball2022</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">#TunisiaKit</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">#Qatar2022</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@BestPESKits</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@PesUniverse</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@EditemosPES</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@PESMasterSite</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Gt08H2bltf</a></p><p>— JPKits (@Jamprice2022) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">September 29, 2022</a></p><p>Hang on, this is just the same as the home kit isn’t it? Just white instead of red, with the same pattern ‘inspired by the armour of Hannibal’ on the background? This is a test of our generally positive attitude to away shirts that are mirrors of the home shirt, because these aren’t quite complementary items as just plain copies of each other.</p><p>And, on a more basic, aesthetic level, the pattern doesn’t quite work as well in white as it does red, carrying with it that problem of it making the white shirt look like it’s been washed with a blue sock.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Rating: 6/10</p><h3 class=p1>Uruguay</h3><p dir=ltr lang=en>.<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@Uruguay</a>’s new 2022 World Cup away kit</p><p>Thoughts? 👍 👎 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/V4sKFeR12k</a></p><p>— Uruguay Football ENG (@UruguayFootENG) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">August 29, 2022</a></p><p>Lovely. Really nice. Plain, but the white and that shade of sky blue go nicely together. The collar works really well, paired well with the cuffs, and the stripes down the middle are a slightly unusual touch but are quite effective. Of course, nobody can enjoy any of that because of the giant child’s shield in the middle ruining the whole shirt.
